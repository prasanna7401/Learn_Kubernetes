Here, we will setup an ingress controller for any existing service (say, `kubernetes-dashboard` by `minikube`)

Uses of Ingress Controller:

- When you don't want to expose any of the K8s component (LB).
- A Separate Ingress controller will route the traffic based on ingress rules to the specific services.
