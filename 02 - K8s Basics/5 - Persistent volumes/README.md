### Note
**Persistent Volumes:**
- The attributes in the yaml file are specific to each storage type. 
- Volumes cannot be placed inside a namespace.
- DO NOT use local volumes for persistent storage for databases, as they do not tie to a specific node, and it may not survive cluster crashes.

**Persistent Volume Claim**
- `PersistentVolumeClaim` is used by an application to claim the use of a persistent volume. This must be in the same namespace as the pod using the claim.

**Special local volumes**
- You can also use `ConfigMap`, or `Secret` as these are a type of local volumes managed by K8s.

**Storage Class**
- Allocate/Provision persistent volumes dynamically, whenever a PVC claims it.
